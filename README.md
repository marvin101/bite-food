## Project Overview  
Describe what the project does (e.g., a dashboard to explore popular food dishes, user favorite management, etc.). Share the main goal—what problem it aims to solve or what functionality it provides.

## Features  
- User sign-up and login (based on presence of `signup.html`, `login.php`)  
- Dashboard interface (`dashboard.html`, `dashboard.js`, `dashboard.php`)  
- Display of popular items or categories (`popular.html`)  
- Settings or profile management (`settings.json`, `settings.css`)  
- Logout handling (`logout.php`)  

Feel free to elaborate or adjust these bullet points to match real functionality.

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: PHP  
- **Assets**: Images (e.g., `wall.jpg`, `logo.png`), JSON configuration  
- **Dependencies**: Defined in `package.json` (list them as needed)

## Setup & Installation
